bonjourfoxy (0.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reworked the debian-specific files to be able to use dpkg-buildpackage
    on the upstream sources
  * Fixed build process for nix targets that was not copying several
    important files needed for the components during make install
  * Comments on 0.8.0 from upstream:
  The Mozilla Add-ons team have okay'd release 0.8.0. This release adds
  support for multiple entries in TXT records which allows the Bonjour
  Browser to displays more information about resolved services. The Bonjour
  Browser has also been enhanced to display a description of service types
  it's familiar with.
  The first alpha release of BonjourFoxy 0.8.0 exposes an updated API
  allowing for multiple key-value pairs to be registered and retrieved for a
  service. This new functionality is most evident in the Bonjour Browser
  which now shows many more details about a service.
  Additional enhancements for release 0.8.0 include an updated sidebar
  interface and self-diagnostic utilities; however these changes are not
  quite ready for this release.
